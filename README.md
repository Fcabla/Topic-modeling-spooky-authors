# Topic-modeling-spooky-authors
Hands-on for Intelligent systems

The problem to be solved in this natural language processing project is to discover possible abstract themes that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a very useful tool when trying to discover hidden semantic structures in texts.
The dataset to be used contains excerpts from horror novels by authors Edgar Allan Poe (EAP), Mary Shelley (MWS), and HP Lovecraft (HPL). This dataset comes from a competition in 2017 on the popular Kaggle web community, it can be found at the following web URL:
